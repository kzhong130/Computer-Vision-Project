- Color removal
- Channel extraction (RGB)
- Adjust hue / saturation / lightness (HSL)
- Rotation, Crop and resize
- Various ways to map grey values
2. Binarization
- Otus
- Arbitrary threshold
3. Filtering
- Gaussian / median / mean filter
- Convolution with user-specified core
4. Edge detection
- Sobel / Laplace operator
- Canny edge detection
5. Morphology
- Erosion, dilation, opening, closing
- Morphological reconstruction
- Thinning and thickening 
- Skeleton
- Distance transformation
6. Algebra operation
- addition, subtraction, multiplication)
